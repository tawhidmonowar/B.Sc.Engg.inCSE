1. What is Proposition?
-- Proposition is declarative sentence which can be TRUE or FALSE but cannot be both.

2. What is Propositional Variables?
-- Variables that are use to represent propositions are called Propositional variables.

3. Logical Operators
- Negation '¬' "It is not the case that P"
- Conjunction '^' "and/but"
- Disjunction/Inclusiv or '∨' "or"
- Exclusive OR/XOR '⊕' "both can't be true"
- Implication/conditional statement '→' "if P then Q"
-- Converse 'Q→P'
-- Contrapositive '¬Q→¬P'
- - Inverse '¬P→¬Q'
- Bitconditional '↔' "P if and only if Q" true if p and q are same.S (if and only if = iff)

4. Why "P only if Q" is not equivalent to "if Q then P"?
-- P only if Q is false when p is TRUE and Q is FALSE, as when p is true and Q is false, "p only if q" is false but with same truth values of p and q, "if q then p" is true. Therefore "p only if q" is not equivalent to "if q then p".

6. What is tautology?
- Compound proposition which is alwaye TRUE.

7. What is Contradiction?
- Compound proposition which is alwaye FALSE.

8. What is Contingency?
- Compound proposition which is sometimes TRUE sometimes FALSE.

9. What is Satisfiability?
- A compound proposition is satisfiable if there is at least one TRUE result in its truth table.

10. What is Unsatisfiability?
- Not even a single TRUE result in its truth table.

11. What is Valid?
-  A compound  proposition is valid when its a tautology.

12. What is Invalid?
- A compound  proposition is Invalid when it is either a contyradiction or contingency.
