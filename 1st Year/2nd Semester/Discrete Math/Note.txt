1. What is Proposition?
-- Proposition is declarative sentence which can be TRUE or FALSE but cannot be both.
		
2. Not Proposition-
-1. Questions.
-2. Commands / Imperative.
-3. If value is not defind ex.(x+2=5).
-4. Opinion.

3. What is Propositional Variables / Statement Variables?
-- Variables that are use to represent propositions are called propositional variables.

4. What is Compound Proposition?
-- Compound proposition is a proposition formed by combining two or more simple proposition.

5. What is Connectives?
-- The logical operators that are used to form compound proposition is called connectives.

6. Logical Operators
-1. Negation '¬' "NOT"
-2. Conjunction '^' "AND"
-3. Disjunction '∨' "OR"
-4. Exclusive OR/ExOR '⊕' "Both can't be true"
-5. Implication/conditional statement '→' "if P then Q"
--5.1- Converse 'Q→P'
--5.2- Contrapositive '¬Q→¬P'
- -5.3- Inverse '¬P→¬Q'
-6. Equivalence / Bitconditional '↔' "if and only if / iff"

# Negation '¬' "NOT"
* Today is Friday.
= Today is not friday.
= It is not the case that today is friday.
Ex: if today is friday = p then the negation is ¬p

* 6 is negative.
= It is not case that 6 is negative.

* 2+1 = 3.
= 2+1 ≠ 3.

* There is no polution in new jersey.
= There is polution in new jersey.

* The summer in marine is hot and sunny.
= It is not the case that the summer in marine is hot and sunny.

# Conjunction '^' "AND"
* Today is friday and its raining.
Ex: if p=true and q= true only then p^q=true. Else, false.

# Disjunction '∨' "OR"
* Today is friday or its raining.
Ex: if p=false and q=false only then p∨q= false. Else, true.

# ExOR '⊕' "Both can't be true"
* Students who have taken calculus or computer science, can join the class but not both.
Ex: if p=true and q = true or p=false and q=false then p⊕q=false. Else, true.

# Conditional statement '→' "if P then Q","if p,q","p is sufficient for","q if p"
* If today is holiday then store is close.
Ex: if p=true and q=false then p→q= false. Else, true.


#conditional statement 



















4. Why "P only if Q" is not equivalent to "if Q then P"?
-- P only if Q is false when p is TRUE and Q is FALSE, as when p is true and Q is false, "p only if q" is false but with same truth values of p and q, "if q then p" is true. Therefore "p only if q" is not equivalent to "if q then p".

6. What is tautology?
- Compound proposition which is alwaye TRUE.

7. What is Contradiction?
- Compound proposition which is alwaye FALSE.

8. What is Contingency?
- Compound proposition which is sometimes TRUE sometimes FALSE.

9. What is Satisfiability?
- A compound proposition is satisfiable if there is at least one TRUE result in its truth table.

10. What is Unsatisfiability?
- Not even a single TRUE result in its truth table.

11. What is Valid?
-  A compound  proposition is valid when its a tautology.

12. What is Invalid?
- A compound  proposition is Invalid when it is either a contyradiction or contingency.
